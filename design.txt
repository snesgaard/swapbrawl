# Combat Basics

Up to three player characters will be on the field itself, the rest in reserve.
On-field characters will be able to perform traditional actions such as
attacking, casting spells defending etc. Reserve characters can dynamically be
swapped in and provide assists as part of an offensive or defensive action.

The primary action currency is stamina. All action will require it. Reserve characters
recorder stamina automatically (e.g. every fourth turn). Front characters recover
only as a part of a spell or when defending.

Each character has two assist, one for offensive and one for defensive.
Respectively performed during allied or foe attacks. An assist will swap out
the reserve character for the afflicted front character.

Combat ends when all characters on one side is incapacitated.

# Spell Casting
Casting a spell can be initialized by a front character. This will put a cast
action into the turn queue. On this action the character can release the spell
or continue chanting to build up power. This can be repeated three times.
